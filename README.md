### **BlindSight**  
An affordable (<$100), low-resolution (3Ã—4) tactile interface that helps the visually impaired perceive their surroundings.  

BlindSight uses a **Raspberry Pi Pico** to process **Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor data**, mapping depth information onto **12 custom actuators** (servo motors) that press against the user's fingers, providing a real-time spatial representation of their environment.
